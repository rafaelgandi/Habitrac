CALCULATING A PERCENTAGE
========================

The term 'percent' means 'one hundredth', so to find 1% of a figure you 
simply divide it by 100.

For example, if John scores 60 out of 75 in mathematics we can find the 
percentage of his marks by dividing 60 by 75, which is 0.8 and then 
multiplying this figure by 100. This gives us the percentage of his 
marks in math, which is 80%. 


(60/75) x 100 = 80%


-------------------------
ok = 7 -> 87.5%
fail = 1 -> 12.5%
total = 8
